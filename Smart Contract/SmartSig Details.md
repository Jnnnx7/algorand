# SmartSig Details

* Smart signatures are primarily used to delegate signature authority.
* Most Algorand transactions are authorized by a signature from a single account or a multisignature account. 
Algorandâ€™s smart signatures allow for a third type of signature using a Transaction Execution Approval Language (TEAL) program, called a logic signature (**LogicSig**).
* Smart signatures provide two modes for TEAL logic to operate as a LogicSig, to create a contract account that functions similar to an escrow or to delegate signature authority to another account.
